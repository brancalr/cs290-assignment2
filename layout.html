		 The hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks. Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back, chas'd that from his which newly they had worn, and inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one
	     who listens, stood attentive: for his eye not far could lead him through the sable air, and the thick-gath'ring cloud.  "It yet behooves we win this fight"—thus he began—"if not—
	     such aid to us is offer'd.—Oh, how long me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!" I noted, how the sequel of his words clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake 
		 agreed not with the first. But not the less my fear was at his saying; sith I drew to import worse perchance, than that he held,his mutilated speech. "Doth ever any into this 
		 rueful concave's extreme depth descend, out of the first degree, whose pain is deprivation merely of sweet hope?" Thus I inquiring. "Rarely," he replied, "It chances, that among us any makes
		 this journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades back to their bodies.  No long space my flesh
	     was naked of me, when within these walls she made me enter, to draw forth a spirit from out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  
		 The road full well I know: thou therefore rest secure. That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round the city' of grief encompasses, which now we may not enter without rage."  Yet more
	     He added: but I hold it not in mind, for that mine eye toward the lofty tower had drawn me wholly, to its burning top. Where in an instant I beheld uprisen at once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:
		 In limb and motion feminine they seem'd; around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd their volumes; adders and cerastes crept instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.</p>
	 <p>He knowing well the miserable hags who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left this is Megaera; on the right hand she, who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone
	    I' th' midst."  This said, in silence he remain'd their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd, that to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.
	    "Hasten Medusa: so to adamant him shall we change;" all looking down exclaim'd. "E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took no ill revenge."  "Turn thyself round, and keep thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
		be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return upwards would be for ever lost."  This said, himself my gentle master turn'd me round, nor trusted he my hands, but with his own he also hid me.  Ye of intellect
	    Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd under close texture of the mystic strain! And now there came o'er the perturbed waves loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made either shore tremble, as if of a wind
		impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung, that 'gainst some forest driving all its might, plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps its whirlwind rage, 
		while beasts and shepherds fly. Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: "And now direct thy visual nerve along that ancient foam, there, thickest where the smoke ascends." As frogs before their foe the serpent, through the wave
		ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound. He, from his face removing the gross air,
		oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone by that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd that he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand quiet, and bend to him. 
		Ah me! how full of noble anger seem'd he! To the gate he came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat open without impediment it flew.</p>
